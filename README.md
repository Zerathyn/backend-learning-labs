# Laravel Learning Labs

A collection of Laravel practice projects built during my learning journey.
This repository focuses only on Laravel and its ecosystem:

- Laravel fundamentals and advanced topics
- REST APIs
- PostgreSQL integration
- Authentication & payments
- WebSockets
- Nginx configuration
- Docker environment setups
- Redis caching & queues
- CI/CD pipelines
- PHPUnit testing
- Performance optimization

Each folder contains a small learning lab or revision project.
These are not production applications — they are experiments created to
practice and reinforce Laravel concepts and tooling.
