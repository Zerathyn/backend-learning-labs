# Laravel Learning Labs

A collection of Laravel practice projects built during my learning journey. This repository focuses only on Laravel and its ecosystem:

- Laravel fundamentals and advanced topics
- REST APIs
- PostgreSQL integration
- Authentication & payments
- WebSockets
- Nginx configuration
- Docker environment setups
- Redis caching & queues
- CI/CD pipelines
- PHPUnit testing
- Performance optimization

Each folder contains a small learning lab or revision project. These are **not production applications** — they are experiments created to practice and reinforce Laravel concepts and tooling.

**What this repo will include:** Over **45 Laravel projects** and **solutions to 90+ LeetCode problems**, purely as a collection of my learning experiments. Everything here is open-source for anyone to explore, but don’t expect full production-ready apps with fancy features.
